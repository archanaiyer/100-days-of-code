# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I set up my basic project. Created a barebones html page with css and js.

**Thoughts** It's been a really really long while since I've done anything other than C#. Took me a while to use my macbook and Github again. I'm realizing how important it is for me to do stuff outside of work and actually keep it up. Building an easy web app. Hope to have it done within a few days and then do something more consequential.
